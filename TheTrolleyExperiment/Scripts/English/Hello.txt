Hello subjet #729, today, you will participate in the D.E.D. (Dangerous ethical dilemmas) project. In this experiment, you will advance from room to room while having to make a choice between two options that are available to you in each room. The choice is completely yours, there is no good, or bad answer so you will not be punished for any decision you make. This experiment will allow us to better understand the human psyche when it is faced with difficult choices. Our company is not responsible for any damage or losses that could possibly be caused by this project. To start the experiment, please activate the lever and pass through the door.
